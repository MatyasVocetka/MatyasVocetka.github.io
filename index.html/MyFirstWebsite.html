        <h1>Matyáš Vocetka</h1>
        <h2>Trainee software developer</h2>
        <p>I am an optimism-nihilistic goal oriented human being little lost in the modern era and would love to find what I'm looking for here, in the Green Fox Academy world. <br> <br>
        Apart from coding, which I newly explore, I like taking part in lot of sports and other social events such as football, poker, and ballroom dancing.</p>
